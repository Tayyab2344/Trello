# Trello Project Overview

## Project Title

Trello Clone with Enhanced Features

## Project Description

A web-based project management application inspired by Trello, designed to facilitate team collaboration and task organization. The application includes organizational boards, lists, draggable cards, authentication, Unsplash background images, and activity tracking.

## Features

### 1. Organizations

- **Description**: Allows users to create and manage multiple organizations to group related boards.
- **Functionality**:
  - Create, edit, and delete organizations.
  - Assign members to organizations with role-based access (Admin, Member, Viewer).
  - View all boards associated with an organization.
- **Implementation**:
  - Backend: Store organization data in a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
  - Frontend: Display organizations in a sidebar or dashboard.

### 2. Boards

- **Description**: Boards represent projects or workflows within an organization.
- **Functionality**:
  - Create, rename, and delete boards.
  - Assign boards to specific organizations.
  - Customize board visibility (public, private, or organization-only).
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a drag-and-drop interface for board management.
  - Store board metadata (title, description, organization ID) in the database.

### 3. Lists

- **Description**: Lists are containers for cards within a board, representing stages or categories (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Functionality**:
  - Add, rename, and delete lists within a board.
  - Reorder lists via drag-and-drop.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a library like `react-beautiful-dnd` or `dnd-kit` for drag-and-drop functionality.
  - Persist list order in the backend.

### 4. Draggable Cards

- **Description**: Cards represent individual tasks or items within a list.
- **Functionality**:
  - Create, edit, and delete cards.
  - Drag cards between lists to update their status.
  - Add details to cards: title, description, due dates, assignees, labels, and attachments.
- **Implementation**:
  - Implement drag-and-drop using the same library as lists.
  - Store card data (title, description, list ID, position) in the database.
  - Support real-time updates for collaborative editing using WebSockets.

### 5. Authentication

- **Description**: Secure user access and data protection.
- **Functionality**:
  - User registration and login.
  - Role-based access control for organizations and boards.
  
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a service like Firebase Authentication, Auth0, or a custom JWT-based system.
  - Secure API endpoints with authentication middleware.

### 6. Unsplash Background Images

- **Description**: Enhance board aesthetics with customizable background images from Unsplash.
- **Functionality**:

  - Allow users to select background images from Unsplash for boards.

  - Save selected images as board backgrounds.

- **Implementation**:
  - Integrate Unsplash API to fetch and display images.
  - Store the selected image URL or ID in the board's metadata.
  - Cache images locally to improve performance.

### 7. Activity Tracking

- **Description**: Track and display actions performed on boards, lists, and cards.
- **Functionality**:

  - Log actions such as card creation, movement, updates, and comments.

- **Implementation**:
  - Store activity logs in the database with timestamps and user IDs.
  - Display activities in a scrollable feed with real-time updates.

## Technical Stack
